"""
Stages from the sport's schema (docs/backtest-core.md, step 5): the moments an event is priced and traded,
as new information arrives. A sport's `[stages]` table says how its session schedule becomes stages:

    [stages]
    pre_label = "pre-weekend"   # the first stage, before any running ...
    pre_minutes = 60            # ... this long before the first session
    lag_minutes = 30            # a session's data is used this long after it ends
    until = "Race"              # stages stop before this session (it is never traded)
    closes = { race_pole = "Qualifying" }   # a market kind closes when this session starts

    build(sessions, "f1")   -> dict(stages=[(label, cutoff)], closes={kind: time or None}, until=time or None)

sessions: [(name, start)] in time order (naive UTC). A session counts when the schema's session schedule
(`[sessions.schedule]`: name -> [minutes, short label]) lists it; its stage is "after <short label>".
