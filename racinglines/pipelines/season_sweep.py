"""
The season sweep for any sport: every raced event of a season, traded through its stages by the taker modes
(update / hold / last / early) and the maker variants (maker, maker_flat, maker_skew, maker_widen, maker_all) of
pipelines/weekend_sweep.py, against one exchange's recorded tape (markets/venue_replay.py EXCHANGES: Polymarket,
Kalshi, OG.com), then settled on the result. Tuned on one season, held out on another (the search, sweeps/*.toml).

Nothing here names a sport. The sport's schema (sports/<code>.toml) says everything that differs:

    [sweep] stages      the default stage mode, i.e. where the stages and the fair values come from; a sweep picks
                        another one the schema supports with its `stages` setting (sweep_settings.py; a search job's
                        `stages = "weekend"`), so the earlier weekend-based results stay reproducible beside a
                        session-aware path:
        "sessions"      the session schedule ([sessions.schedule], [stages]) through the stage engine (core/stages.py
                        build): a stage before any running, then one after each session (its start + its minutes +
                        lag_minutes), until the race. Needs [sessions.schedule]. Where the sessions come from:
                        - F1 (no [sessions] time_key): FastF1's event schedule, one diagnostic run per stage priced as
                          of each cutoff (pipelines/weekend_sweep.py run_sweep; F1's default and only mode, its results
                          as they were)
                        - [sessions] time_key (NASCAR, MotoGP): the event's stored rounds whose kind is a schedule
                          name, each starting at rounds.extra[time_key] (session_stages). A round that stores no time
                          is not a stage; the race without a stored start ends the stages at [stages]
                          until_fallback_hours on race day; an event with no stored session time at all is traded
                          on its fixed [replay] stages instead (its weekends row says format "weekend"). The pricing
                          model reprices at every stage (stage_sims) with what is known by then: the start list and
                          the sessions run so far (Event.info "field", "sessions")
        "weekend"       fixed weekend stages, [replay] stages (hours from 00:00 UTC on race day), priced once per race
                        by [sport] pricing_model from results strictly before the event (a results-only model: one
                        pricing serves every stage), settled by markets/kinds.settle (pipelines/position_replay.py;
                        NASCAR's and MotoGP's default). Needs [replay] stages
    kinds               [sweep] kinds, else [markets] weekend_kinds ("sessions", where the schema has them) or
                        [replay] kinds
    venues              [markets] venues that are exchanges, then OG.com where exchanges/og.toml lists the sport
    [sweep] late_stages the stages the stage-aware taker ("early") skips (default none)
    [sweep] quote_until_hours
                        "weekend": the hour (UTC) of race day the maker stops quoting

    run(engine, engine_url, "nascar", 2026, settings=settings_class("nascar").from_dict({"venue": "kalshi"}))
        -> dict(weekends, by_stage, by_kind, totals, trades, scores, calibration, reliability, params)
           params carries sport, venue, the settings (settings_key, model_key) and the data fingerprint (data_key)
    settings_class(sport)       the sweep's settings for the sport: its pricing model's own settings plus the shared
                                entry timing, taker, maker and markets settings (pipelines/sweep_settings.py), with the
                                stage labels, kinds and venues of the schema as their choices (F1: sweep_settings.Settings)

Read-only: the "weekend" mode stores nothing (the CLI's --save stores the sweep run itself, kind 'sweep').
