"""
The demo accounts' story, from data: bankroll, track record, and (maker) each strategy decision with the
evidence the account had at that moment.

The maker re-checks its setup in the Lab's Edge Finder at a few decision points (before the first race,
mid-season, before the next season). The evidence is walk-forward: each candidate setup's P&L over only
the weekends raced so far, read from its saved season sweep (every weekend priced as of its own sessions).
Rules:
  - before any weekend has been raced, start on the defaults;
  - mid-season, switch to the setup with the most P&L so far when it beats the current one by more
    than SWITCH_MARGIN;
  - before a new season (a whole season's commitment), take every setup within NOISE_FLOOR of the P&L
    leader (differences smaller than that are simulation noise, per the params-4h search) and commit to
    the most consistent one (the Edge Finder's consistency: mean / s.d. of weekend P&L x sqrt(weekends)).

The Strategy page shows each decision with its evidence (story.account); demo_history replays the result.
