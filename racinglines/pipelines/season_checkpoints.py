"""
Championship-market checkpoints: enter at fixed points in the season, hold, and score each
entry over fixed windows. Built for comparing model variants on the season markets, where
the update-every-race strategy (season_strategy.py) mostly measures how fast the market
reacts to race results.

Entries (fixed before looking at results): pre-season, after 3 grands prix, after 6. At each,
a separate book ("tranche", capital / number of entries) takes the default season sizing
against that moment's as-of forecast (season_strategy.asof_forecasts, per variant) and holds.

Windows: the next WINDOW grands prix after the entry (the same length for every entry, so
entries compare), and to date. Both end at the price one hour after a decision, as traded.

Scores, per tranche and window:
  pnl        liquidation value (price - cost) + settlements - cost basis, as in the replay
  drift      mean move of the market toward our fair value, in points, over the markets
             where |fair - price| >= min_edge at entry: (p_end - p_entry) * sign(fair - p_entry)
  hit        share of those markets where the market moved toward our fair value
  slope      least-squares slope of (p_end - p_entry) on (fair - p_entry) over every
             tradeable market: the share of our edge the market closed. 1 = the market
             went all the way to our number, 0 = our edge told nothing about the move,
             negative = the market moved away. Its SE treats markets as independent, which
             they aren't (a title's probabilities sum to one), so read it as indicative.
