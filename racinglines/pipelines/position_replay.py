"""
Taker replay for the result-only sports (NASCAR Cup, MotoGP): every raced event of a season, priced by the sport's
model and traded at a few fixed times before the race against an exchange's recorded prices.

    out = run(engine, "nascar", [2025, 2026], venue="kalshi")
    out["races"]     one row per race: markets, tradeable, P&L per taker mode (update / hold / last)
    out["trades"]    every trade of the `update` mode, with its P&L to resolution
    out["totals"]    per mode: P&L, Kalshi's taker fees, P&L after fees, races up
    out["by_kind"]   P&L of the `update` trades by market kind
    out["calibration"], out["reliability"]   model vs exchange, scored on the results (core/calibration.py)

The F1 weekend sweep (pipelines/weekend_sweep.py) is not used or changed: its stages come from F1's session
schedule and its fairs from position_sim. Here, per race:

  1. The field is the race's start list (the drivers or riders with a result in its race round: known before the
     start; their positions are read only in step 4).
  2. The model (sports/<code>.toml [sport] pricing_model) prices the race from results strictly before the event
     (race_model.Event with the field in `info`). It uses race results only, so one pricing serves every stage.
  3. At each stage of [replay] stages (hours from 00:00 UTC on race day), the venue (markets/venue_replay.py:
     Kalshi's or Polymarket's recorded prices and tape) says the price and whether the market was tradeable (priced,
     liquid, open, a coherent group), and the taker strategies (markets/strategies/taker_weekend.py) trade.
  4. Only then the result settles each market: by classified position (NASCAR classifies every car, retirements by
     laps run; an unclassified MotoGP rider has no position and is NO for every top-n market).

Markets: the sport's links on the venue whose kind is in [replay] kinds. The kind, driver and race come from the
stored link (NASCAR's `nascar link --apply` writes params.kind, athlete_id and race_id), else from the sport's
matcher run in memory ([replay] linker): nothing is written to market_links.

Run with `racinglines nascar replay` / `racinglines motogp replay` (every exchange the sport lists on, by default).
`save` also stores one as-of model run per race (model_runs kind 'diagnostic' + race_predictions, and prediction
records with the sims, on for these sports unless RACINGLINES_PREDICTION_RECORDS is set off); the CLI asks for a
fresh backup first and every saved run carries the batch
id that `undo` deletes.

`buy_all` (off by default; `--buy-all` or RACINGLINES_BUY_ALL=1) adds the debug mode of
markets/strategies/buy_everything.py: one YES and one NO share of every market open and priced at a stage, with no
edge, volume or coherence filter. It is reported beside the taker's modes, which it does not change.
