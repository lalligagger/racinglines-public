"""
The demo accounts' track record: every past weekend with Polymarket race markets, replayed with the
profile each account ran then (profiles.HISTORY), stored as that account's paper signals and positions.

These are backtest replays, not live paper trades: real Polymarket prices and trade tapes, our as-of
pricing, the backtest's strategy code (signals.compute with live=False, the same path as the sweep).
Every row is flagged detail.backfill and shown as a backtest replay in the app. Live paper signals
(signals.run_all) take over from the next race weekend.

    racinglines f1 demo-history              # backfill (idempotent: existing rows are kept)
    racinglines f1 demo-history --reset      # delete the backfill first, then rebuild it
    racinglines f1 demo-history --venue kalshi [--reset]   # the maker's record on Kalshi instead (off by default)

--venue kalshi replays the maker's same profiles against Kalshi's recorded tape (markets/kalshi/ stores it in
the shared tables), with Kalshi's maker fee, as paper_positions.venue = 'kalshi' and signals flagged
detail.venue = 'kalshi'. The Polymarket record and its reset don't touch those rows, and vice versa. Maker
accounts only (a taker's Kalshi paper trading is a profile with the `venue = kalshi` setting, signals.py).
