Strategy profiles: a Lab candidate (model x strategy x settings) assigned to a user, whose live paper
signals the signal engine computes (racinglines/pipelines/signals.py).

The two recommended by the params-4h cloud search (data/runs/search/params-4h/REPORT.md, section 4):

    A  core taker: the update taker on gridq+pretrain+reset, edges of 10 pts or more (5 on head-to-head),
       no pre-weekend stage.                                                    (candidate #09 + min_edge_h2h)
    C  maker sleeve: the conservative maker on gbm, 25-share quotes, out of markets where the model
       disagrees with the price by more than 5 pts.                              (candidate #24)

    K  Kalshi maker: the conservative maker tuned on Kalshi's own 2025-26 tape (docs/kalshi-history.md,
       sweeps/kalshi-maker-k.toml); the settings below are the sweep's winner under the params-4h
       held-out rule. The candidate carries venue = "kalshi": it is judged on and quotes Kalshi.

    racinglines f1 profiles                      # list, and create A / C / K as Lab candidates if missing
    racinglines f1 profiles --assign-demo        # demo taker -> A, demo maker -> C
    racinglines f1 profiles --assign-demo --venue kalshi   # demo maker -> K, as its Kalshi profile (explicit;
                                                           # nothing reads it until the signal engine runs Kalshi)

    T1..T10  the taker shortlist (TAKER_TOP, ranked; source "taker-resweep"): what pro accounts pick from, and
             the pool a basic account's three picks are drawn from (web/roles.basic_members).
    TB       a blend (COMBOS): members [(code, weight)] instead of one strategy; each member runs as itself with
             its stakes scaled by its weight (signals.compute_all). Not a Lab candidate.

A user's profile lives in users.prefs["strategy_profile"] with the full settings, so deleting the
candidate doesn't break the assignment. A Kalshi profile lives beside it in prefs["strategy_profile_kalshi"]
(PREF_KALSHI), so the Polymarket profile and everything reading it are untouched.
