"""
Demo paper portfolios for the result-only sports (NASCAR Cup, MotoGP): each past race's taker replay
(pipelines/position_replay.py) stored as backfilled paper positions and signals of a demo account, so the web app
shows them beside the F1 demo history (pipelines/demo_history.py). Off by default: RACINGLINES_SPORT_PAPER=1 turns
on both the writer and the app's reading of these rows (nav P&L, Positions, Signals).

    racinglines nascar demo-history --pick data/runs/replay-grid/nascar             # print the selection, write nothing
    racinglines nascar demo-history --grid data/runs/replay-grid/nascar --backup FILE [--users taker] [--events latest]
    racinglines nascar demo-history --reset --backup FILE [--users taker]            # this sport's rows only

The strategy per market kind is the settings grid's best (the overnight run's read-only grid, scripts/vm/replay_grid.py,
runs named <year>-e<edge>-v<volume> under data/runs/replay-grid/<sport>/, each with kalshi/trades.csv):

  per kind (--book kinds, the default): for each market kind, the grid setting (min edge, 24 h volume floor) whose
  worse season's net P&L on that kind (after Kalshi's taker fee) is highest; a kind whose best setting still lost money
  in its worse season is not traded (a season with no trade at any setting, as MotoGP 2025 on Kalshi, is left out of
  the test rather than counted as $0). The blend (--book blend): the one setting with the best worse season over every
  kind together (grid.md's top row at the default simulations).

Both are chosen on the same seasons they are then replayed on: IN-SAMPLE, a demo, not a forecast. Every row is labelled
so (profile name, detail.book, detail.in_sample). Only the taker's `update` mode is ever stored: never the debug
buy_all mode (markets/strategies/buy_everything.py), which the replay is run with switched off.

Rows: strategy_signals with detail.backfill, detail.sport, detail.venue, detail.book, detail.setting; paper_positions on
the venue ('kalshi' by default) with candidate_id NULL and the race's event_key (the sport's own event keys, which never
collide with F1's). Positions carry the venue's taker fee in their cash, so their P&L is after fees. A rebuild replaces
the account's rows for that sport, venue and race; --reset removes them all for the sport and venue, nothing else.
