"""
A walk-forward's fair values scored beside an exchange's prices (docs/backtest-core.md): for every event the
model priced, the venue's last price of each linked market at the event's cutoff (the model's own information:
results on earlier days), against the same result.

    racinglines backtest walk-forward f1 --model global --seasons 2025 2026 --venue polymarket kalshi

Prices are read through markets/venue_replay.py, so nothing after the cutoff is seen, a price older than six hours
is no price, and a multi-outcome group whose prices don't sum near its target (an empty or stale book) gives no
price, as in the sweep. Markets pair on exact keys only: market_links.race_id (the event's race), the kind and
athlete_id. A sport whose links carry no race_id has nothing to pair, and the command says so. The score is
scorecard.score's: n, Brier and log loss of the model on every linked market with a fair value and a result;
paired, and model and venue side by side on those the venue also priced.
