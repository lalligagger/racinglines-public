"""
Live paper signals for any sport on an exchange, run by the sport's own stage mode (pipelines/season_sweep.py):

    racinglines nascar signals                      # every user with a NASCAR profile, on every venue it names
    racinglines motogp signals --venue og --profile 123 --event 2026-5630 --asof 2026-10-03T20:00   # replay, prints only

A profile names its sport (profile["sport"]; F1 when unset) and its venue (the `venue` setting; unset = the sport's
first exchange, season_sweep.settings_class). A user's profile for a sport and venue lives in users.prefs under
profiles.pref(venue, sport). Nothing here names a sport: what differs comes from sports/<code>.toml.

  "sessions" mode (F1): pipelines/signals.py, unchanged (its compute and run_all; this module hands F1 to them).
  "weekend" mode (NASCAR, MotoGP): per race, the schema's fixed [replay] stages (hours from 00:00 UTC on race day).
    1. Data (live only): the venue's tape for the race's markets over the last 26 h (position_replay.pull: the
       24 h volume floor reaches back a day). The recorder's timers keep Kalshi's and OG.com's books as before.
    2. Pricing: the sport's pricing model ([sport] pricing_model) from results strictly before the event, seeded per
       event exactly as the sweep (season_sweep.replay_sweep). Live, each stage whose time has passed gets one stored
       run (model_runs kind 'diagnostic', params mode 'live signals', sweep_stage = the stage label, live = true, the
       field it priced), priced once when the stage first comes due with the race's start list (its own entry list
       once a session is ingested, else the last race's field) and reused by every later pass; a new run is logged
       in data_changes as "live-price". A replay (live=False) prices the race in memory on its classified field, as
       the sweep does, and stores nothing.
    3. Markets: season_sweep.race_markets on the venue (markets/venue_replay.py), each stage read live when its run
       was priced (its trades couldn't be made earlier), in a replay at the stage's time (as the sweep).
    4. Takers: taker_weekend.run_market per market (signals.taker_signals) with the sweep's taker parameters
       (weekend_sweep.taker_params: the venue's fee). Makers: maker_replay on season_sweep.maker_event, up to now.
    5. Store and alert with signals.store / signals._run_one: rows carry detail.sport and detail.venue, positions the
       venue and the sport's own event key.

Paper only: nothing here places an order or reads a trading flag.
