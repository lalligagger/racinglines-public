"""
Default season-long strategy for the championship markets (drivers' and constructors'
champion), replayed through the season on Polymarket's recorded prices.

Decisions: pre-season (PRESEASON_DAYS before the first practice), then one hour
after every race ends. At each, an as-of season forecast (position_sim.pricing.forecast with the
cutoff; only data from sessions that had ended) gives our fair values; the strategy
(racinglines/markets/strategies/season.py) rebalances and holds. Execution is at Polymarket's hourly price one
hour after the decision plus a per-market cost (half the recorded spread, 0.5c if
none recorded, plus 0.5c slippage). Markets with under MIN_VOLUME traded are skipped.

Demo liberty (documented): the pre-season forecast simulates the published 2026 entry
list (identities only) instead of the 2025 field.

The championship sleeve (paper only, off by default; docs/paper-trading.md):

    racinglines f1 season-strategy --paper --venue polymarket --after-round 15
    racinglines f1 season-strategy --paper --venue kalshi --after-round 15

replays the same strategy from pre-season through the decision after round N on one exchange
(Polymarket's championship markets, or Kalshi's KXF1 / KXF1CONSTRUCTORS champion markets, keyed by
ticker) and stores the state after that rebalance as the demo maker's paper positions, marked as
paper_positions.venue = 'season:<exchange>' with event_key '<year>-season' and no candidate. The accounts'
track records (pipelines/story.py track_record) and the signal engine's rebuilds (pipelines/signals.py store)
select their own venues and weekends, and the Positions page shows only markets with signals, so A, C and K's
records don't see the sleeve; `racinglines mcp`'s positions tool lists it under its own venue.
