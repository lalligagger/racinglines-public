"""
Per-weekend reconciliation: a profile's live paper trading of one race weekend against the backtest's
replay of the same weekend on the recorded tape (docs/paper-trading.md, validation rule 1).

    racinglines f1 reconcile --event 2026-15 --profile C --venue polymarket
    racinglines f1 reconcile --event 2026-15 --profile A --user taker --replicates 0 --markdown

Live side: the strategy_signals and paper_positions the signal engine (pipelines/signals.py) stored for
the account on that weekend and venue. Replay side: signals.compute(live=False) as of a day after the
race, the same path as the sweep and the demo backfill (markets read at each stage's cutoff, the maker's
conservative "through" fill rule, the profile's own model and settings). Both sides are reduced to the
same three numbers with the same code:

  fills        paper fills (a taker's buys and sells, a maker's fills)
  markout 60m  each fill's move of the mid over the next hour, signed for our side, summed (adverse
               selection when negative), read from the same tape for both sides
  P&L          held to resolution over the settled markets, as the app sums it (a maker's and a follower's
               from the positions; a taker's own calls from the fills and the outcomes)

The rules (pre-registered, docs/paper-trading.md#validation-plan): live fills and markouts within
+-25% of the replay's, live P&L inside the replay's noise band. The band is built from seed replicates
(docs/backtest-core.md, "noise floor"): the weekend replayed with the profile's model at REPLICATE_SEEDS
besides the default seed (each replicate reprices the stages, cached as diagnostic runs exactly as a sweep
caches them), and the band is the replicates' P&L range, at least +-NOISE_FLOOR wide around their mean
(the search's configured season floors, 150 taker / 350 maker, scaled to one weekend of a 24-round season).
A weekend whose live rows are a backfilled replay (detail.backfill) is a self-check: replay against replay
must match exactly.

Read-only on the accounts' records: nothing here writes a signal or a position. --no-price makes the
command read-only on the database altogether (the band then rests on the cached seeds only, and says so).
