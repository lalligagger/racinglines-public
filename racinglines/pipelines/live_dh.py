Live downhill final: poll UCI's live timing (ChronoRace), simulate the rest of the final, and re-quote.

    racinglines mtb_dh live --slug 20260925_mtb --final 3 --quali 2,91 --conditions "clear, rutted"

Every --interval seconds:
  1. **Feed.** The final's live JSON: who has finished (time), who is on course (latest split), who is
     still to start (start order), DNF / DNS.
  2. **Pace.** Each rider's time blends this weekend's qualifying (best run, sessions put on one scale)
     with the season model's pre-final view (its podium-probability rank mapped onto the field's
     qualifying times; SEASON_WEIGHT). Riders who were mathematically safe to qualify (the season model's
     make-the-final probability in the top quarter of the field, fading to none at the median) may have
     cruised: when their run came out slower than their season rank implies, that gap becomes extra
     uncertainty (wider spread, up to SAFE_SIGMA_CAP) rather than a faster expected time; a fast run is
     genuine pace. The time is
     scaled by how the final is running against qualifying so far (median final/qualifying ratio of the
     finishers, starting from a small prior). A rider on course is projected from the latest split with
     the split-to-finish ratio (finishers of the final, else qualifying). Noise shrinks with the distance
     left; track conditions ("rutted", "wet") widen it and raise the crash / DNF risk.
  3. **Monte Carlo.** N_SIMS simulated finishes -> each rider's probability of every top rank: P(1st),
     P(2nd), P(3rd), top 3, top 5, top 10.
  4. **Maker.** The demo maker quotes YES on "wins" and "podium" for every rider: fair +- a half-spread,
     wider while the rider is on course and just before they start; no quote once the outcome is certain.
     Every quote is appended to the history.
  5. **Taker.** The demo taker's picks (picks.json, chosen once; see make_picks) are marked against the
     quotes and settled when the final is over.

Files: data/runs/live/<slug>_<key>/
    latest.json        the newest snapshot (the web app's Live tab reads it)
    history.jsonl      one line per poll: counts, every market's fair value and quote

    meta.json          the model inputs and parameters (qualifying times, split ratios, season priors,
                       conditions), written on the first poll and whenever they change
    book.json          the maker's private book: position and cash per market, crowd totals, the seeds
    crowd.jsonl        every anonymous crowd fill, per poll, with that poll's random seed
    raw/<ts>.json.gz   every raw feed response, as received      } kept permanently, so the final can be
