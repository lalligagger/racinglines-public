"""
F1 frames (L1, docs/frames.md), built from `Measurements`: the data object `PositionSim.load` returns. Read-only
views over what the model already holds: no database query, and nothing about how the model loads or prices changes.

    entrants          Measurements.res: one row per (event, driver); team_id is the model's team key
    sessions          Measurements.res: one row per (event, session); start from the session timestamp
    classifications   Measurements.res: every session's result rows (practice rows have no position or time; the
                      sprint qualifying rows are all DNS, as the source records them)
    conditions        Measurements.prof: rain share and track temperature of the qualifying and the race
    venue_features    Measurements.prof: the whole track profile, as {feature: value} (nulls left out)
    official_results  the race's classification rows (the sprint stays in classifications, session "sprint")

`available_at` (naive UTC, like everything in position_sim):
  - Session rows (sessions, classifications): the session's end, start + `[sessions] minutes` in sports/f1.toml,
    through position_sim.model.session_end, the function Measurements.view gates `res` with. No lag is added: the
    30 minutes of `[stages] lag_minutes` move a stage's *cutoff* after a session ends, and `view` has none.
  - official_results: the race's end, the same rule.
  - conditions, venue_features: come from `track_profiles`, computed from the race results, so a profile is
    knowable once its race is over: `ready_ts + RACE_DONE`, the gate Measurements.view applies to `prof`. Practice
    weather isn't in the profile, so conditions covers "qual" and "race" only.
  - entrants: the end of the driver's first session of the event, i.e. when our tables first list them. Assumption to
    review in E2: the real entry list is published earlier, but nothing in the tables says when, and this can only be
    late, never early. `price_race` reads the entry list from the ungated `meas.res` ("identities and teams, never
    results"), so pricing before the first session still sees entrants: E2 has to carry that exception over.

Not built: `laps`. Measurements keeps measures derived from the laps (qualifying and race deficits, sector deficits,
practice pace, race disruption), not the laps, so no lap-level frame can come from it. `[data] frames` in
sports/f1.toml doesn't list it; a later task decides how the raw laps reach the adapter.

A row whose session has no timestamp gets a null `available_at`, and `validate` rejects it: nothing is dropped silently.
