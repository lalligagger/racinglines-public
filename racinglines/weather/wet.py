"""
Will the race be wet? A probability of rain for an F1 race window from Open-Meteo's global models, the same way live
and in the backtest (docs/weather.md#wet-race-forecast), and its walk-forward backtest against the race props.

The signal is a vote: each of MODELS (seven global models) votes "wet" when it forecasts at least WET_MM in any hour of
the race window (WINDOW_H around the start, UTC). p_wet shrinks the vote share to the circuit's climatology (its past
wet share, props.rate(hist, venue, "wet")):

    p_wet = (wet_votes + PRIOR_VOTES * climatology) / (models_with_data + PRIOR_VOTES)

Open-Meteo archives each model's earlier runs (the Previous Runs API, `<variable>_previous_dayN`: the run issued N
days before, leads 1-7, all seven models from about February 2024; before that JMA alone: leads 1-4 in 2020, 1-7 in
2021-23), but not its precipitation probability, so the vote is what can be backtested. `racinglines weather leads` pulls them per race
into open_meteo.LEAD_COLUMNS (committed: tests/fixtures/weather/open_meteo-leads-f1.csv). Live, `fetch_live` asks the
forecast API for the same models and `racinglines weather fetch --session race=...` saves the vote next to the issue
(wet-<issued>.json); the live book's props read it (pipelines/live_f1.py).
