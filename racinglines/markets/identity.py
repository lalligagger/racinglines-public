"""
Which driver and race a market is about, for the sports whose schema names a resolver ([identity] resolver in
sports/<code>.toml). A sync builds its link rows, hands them to `linker(sport, conn).fill(rows)`, and stores what comes
back: the same answer whichever exchange the rows came from, and the same one the database pass gives the links
already stored (`racinglines <sport> link`). A sport with no resolver gets None and nothing changes.

    L = linker("nascar", conn)
    if L:
        L.fill(rows)            # sets athlete_id / race_id / params on each row; never raises
        promote("nascar", rows)  # prediction = params.kind where the sport's schema files that kind and it is identified
        stats["identity"] = dict(L.counts)

`promote` is the schema-driven classification of a sport the title classifier doesn't know: a link takes its
params.kind as its prediction when the kind is a registry kind (markets/kinds.toml), the sport's [markets] kinds list it,
and the link names everything the kind needs (identified below). Anything else stays `unmodeled`, its params.kind kept.
