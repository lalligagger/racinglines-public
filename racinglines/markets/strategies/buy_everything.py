"""
Debug strategy "buy one of everything": at the first stage a market is open and priced strictly inside (0, 1), buy
one YES share and one NO share of it, then hold to resolution. No edge, volume, price band or group coherence check;
the model's fair value is not read. The venue's costs still apply (the per-share cost and, where the caller passes
one, the taker fee), so a market's pair loses exactly its costs and fees; what the P&L cells show is that every
market of a sport x exchange reached the replay, was priced and settled (and per side, how YES and NO fared).

Off by default: the replays run it only when asked (`--buy-all` on `racinglines nascar|motogp replay`, or
RACINGLINES_BUY_ALL=1, which the F1 weekend sweep reads too). Backtest and paper only; nothing here places an order.
It is reported as its own mode, `buy_all`, beside the taker's modes, whose results are unchanged.

A stage may carry `open` (False = the market had closed by then) and, from recorded order books, `depth_yes` /
`depth_no` (shares at the touch): a side with no depth there is not bought. Both are optional.
