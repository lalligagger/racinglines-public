Settlement of a race that is cancelled or moved (docs/paper-trading.md, "Cancelled and relocated races"; roadmap U8).

A market kind says what pays when the race runs (markets/kinds.py). This module says what each venue pays when it
doesn't: one table per venue, applied on top of the result-based settlement everywhere paper positions settle
(the private book's settle_from_results, the weekend sweep's markets that the signal engine's paper positions are
built from, and the maker replay). Everything here is behind a switch that is OFF by default:

    RACINGLINES_CANCELLED_RACE_RULES=1        or  rules=True on the settlement call

so the settlement output without it is unchanged. With the switch off, a cancelled race simply never settles
(no classification) and a relocated race settles on its result, as before.

Race status
    cancelled   the race never ran (events.status = 'cancelled' in the database, RACE_STATUS below, or the
                env RACINGLINES_RACE_STATUS="f1:2026-22=cancelled,f1:2026-23=cancelled").
    relocated   the race ran at another circuit under the same name (2026 round 16: the Bahrain GP at Sepang,
                listed as "Bahrain Grand Prix in Malaysia"). Its markets settle on the race that was run: the
                result. RACE_STATUS records it so the rule (and the test) is explicit.
    None        a normal race.

What each venue's published rules say (checked 2026-09-29 against the venues' own market rules; see
docs/paper-trading.md, "Cancelled and relocated races", for the wording and links):
    Polymarket, cancelled
        RULE: the driver / constructor markets say the market resolves to "Other" if the race is cancelled or
        rescheduled past a deadline about a week after the scheduled date. FACT in the archive
        (data/archive/markets/polymarket/links, the April 2026 Bahrain markets): 174 named markets resolved NO
        and the 9 "Other" markets ("Will any other driver win ...?") YES; 23 not recorded. The rescheduled race
        (round 16, October) got new markets, which settle on the race at Sepang.
        RULE: the head-to-head markets say "If a Grand Prix is permanently canceled, the market will resolve
        50-50" (a tie between the two drivers resolves 50-50 too); a postponed race keeps the market open
        until the race is completed. Encoded as a 0.5 payout (`cancelled_binary`).
    Kalshi, cancelled
        RULE: the F1 race markets (winner, podium, pole, the head-to-heads) say a race postponed but started
        within 48 hours of its scheduled start settles on the official result, and "if the race is cancelled or
        not started within 48 hours of its originally scheduled start, all markets will resolve to a fair
        price": Kalshi settles every contract at the last fair market price it determines (rulebook 6.3(c):
        usually the last traded price, else its Outcome Review Committee's figure). It does NOT resolve NO, and
        it does not void (refund at cost). Encoded as FAIR: each market settles at its last recorded price
        (`apply(..., last_price=...)`), which stands in for Kalshi's figure. Kalshi's own market on whether the
        race happens (KXF1OCCUR-26ADGP, "take place in Abu Dhabi before December 7, 2026") is a separate,
        unmodeled market and is not settled here.
    Private book, cancelled
        Our own rule: every bet is void, stakes returned (private_book.settle(outcome=None)).
    Any venue, relocated
        Markets on the race as run settle on its result. FACT for Polymarket round 16 (listed anew for Sepang);
        Kalshi's "originally scheduled for" wording points the same way; the private book's spec is the race.
    Still an approximation: which price Kalshi calls fair (we use the last recorded price of the market), and
    Polymarket's deadline for a rescheduled race (a race run within its window settles on the result here).
