"""
Market kinds as payoffs (docs/backtest-core.md): one definition per kind gives both its fair value,
from a model's simulations (racinglines/models/outcomes.py), and its settlement, from the official
result. Any sport whose model returns an `OutcomeSims` gets every kind here without new code.

    KINDS["race_podium"]                 the definition: top_n(3)
    fair("race_podium", sims)            per-entrant fair values, aligned with sims.entrants
    fair("race_h2h", sims, a, b)         one pair: P(a classified ahead of b)
    settle("race_win", athlete_id, params, res)   YES / NO / None (undecidable) from the classification

Settlement reads the result frame of private_book.race_outcomes (athlete_id, position, status,
qual_position, team_id, points) and is what private_book.outcome_for returns.

Every kind is a row of markets/kinds.toml, so a new kind is a table in that file, not a branch here (owner,
2026-10-06: "as few conditional code switches in the model, and more generalized support functions who's inputs are
set by the schemas"). Two kinds of row. The declarative kinds (the sportsbook classification and retirement markets,
the exact place, the team pole and points rank, ...) are specs: subject / predicate / aggregate / compare, priced and
settled by the two generic functions of racinglines/markets/payoffs.py. The legacy kinds name a payoff instead (top_n,
stage_top_n, reached, h2h, group_top, standings, indicator, mover), each one function below whose inputs (n, stage,
session, exact) come from the row: their fair values feed the golden tests and the live book, and moving them onto
specs is a later change under the promotion rule (docs/f1-roadmap.md).
