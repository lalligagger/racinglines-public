"""
What every race model simulates, in one shape (docs/backtest-core.md): the contract between a
sport's model and the shared market, backtest and search code.

A race model's Monte Carlo gives, per simulation, a classification of the entrants. Every market
we price (win, podium, top 10, pole, head-to-head, makes the Final, top team) is a function of it,
so market code reads an `OutcomeSims` and never a model's own arrays. A yes/no the classification
doesn't decide, which a model draws itself (F1's fastest lap), rides along in `indicators`.

    sims = from_position_sim(entrants, sim)     # F1: pricing.price_race's extras["sim"], ["entrants"]
    sims = from_timed_runs(riders, sim)         # downhill: timed_runs.model.simulate_weekend
    markets.kinds.fair("race_podium", sims)     # per-entrant fair values

Adapters only re-label arrays (no copies of the random draws, no new randomness), so prices built on
an `OutcomeSims` equal the model's own summaries exactly.
