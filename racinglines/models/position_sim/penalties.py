"""
Confirmed grid penalties (sports/f1/grid_penalties.toml), applied to a race's grid before it is simulated.

    load(path=None)                          every [[penalty]] row, validated ([] when the file or table is missing)
    for_event(event_key, session, cutoff)    the rows for one event ("2026-17") and session ("race", "sprint")
    apply(grid, entrants, penalties)         the grid with the penalised drivers moved, renumbered 1..n

The pricer (pricing.price_race / price_stages) hands apply to model.simulate_race as its `grid_adjust`, which runs it
on the known or the drawn grid after every draw, so no random draw is added or moved and a weekend without a
penalty prices byte-identically. Pure numpy, no RNG.

Kinds: "back" and "pit_lane" (priced as a back-of-grid start) go behind everyone else, in their qualifying order;
"places" drops a driver N places, the drivers behind him closing up, never behind the back-of-grid group.
