"""
Combo (same-game parlay) prices for one F1 event: the Lab job `f1_combo` (racinglines/web/jobs.py), run as
`racinglines f1 --variant <v> combo --event 2026-17 --legs '<json>' [--cutoff ...] --save`.

    parse_combos(text)                   the --legs JSON as [(name, [leg, ...])]
    resolve(legs, entrants)              names -> athlete ids and team keys, exact keys only (never fuzzy)
    checks(sims)                         the simulation's own P(pole-sitter wins), P(winner sets the fastest lap)
    combo_metrics(combos, sims, ...)     what the run stores in model_runs.metrics
    price_event(meas, hist, key, ...)    one pricing of the event as of the cutoff (the live stage path's inputs)

The event is priced once (pricing.price_race, as of the cutoff, the same as-of rule as every diagnostic) and every
combo is read from the same simulations (markets/combos.py), with each leg's marginal beside the combo's fair value.

Calibration flags (owner, 2026-10-07). Two correlations the combos lean on are checked against real races and written
next to the prices. A combo with a pole leg priced before qualifying (the grid not known yet) carries
`calibrated: false` and the gap between the simulation's P(pole-sitter wins) and the historical rate: the simulation's
qualifying-to-race link is too weak (about 20 % against 59 %), so win + pole is underpriced until that is fixed (a
follow-up, not this change). After qualifying the pole leg is decided and win + pole is the win given that grid. A
combo with a fastest-lap leg carries the same flag when the run's P(winner sets the fastest lap) is far from history
(the `fastlap` draw; `flpos` lands near it).
