"""
F1 race props (F1 roadmap F1-3): safety car, red flag, rain and fastest lap, priced from the race history in
the database. Off by default: nothing prices them unless a live event lists their kinds ([live.markets] kinds
in sports/f1.toml or a launch spec).

    race_safety_car            a safety car is deployed in the race (track status 4 on any lap; a VSC alone is NO)
    race_red_flag              the race is red-flagged (track status 5 on any lap)
    race_rain                  rain falls during the race (any weather sample with rainfall: rounds.extra.weather)
    race_fastest_lap:<athlete> the driver sets the race's fastest lap (the quickest timed lap, deleted laps left out)

The three yes/no props are per-circuit rates shrunk to the field's rate: the field rate counts as PRIOR_N races
against a circuit's own record, over every race finished before the event starts. Rain uses the history only:
no weather forecast. Measured walk-forward on 2022-2026 (107 races, `--check`): a circuit's own record doesn't
beat the field rate within the noise (lighter shrinkage, e.g. 4, was worse), so PRIOR_N is a heavy 16.

Wet or dry (decision log 2026-10-06, provisional): a race is `wet` when any weather sample had rain (rain_share > 0,
the `rain` rule). `rate_given` is a prop's rate among a circuit's wet (or dry) races, shrunk to the field's wet (or
dry) rate, itself shrunk to the overall field rate; `rate_wx` mixes the two with a probability of rain:
p_wet * rate_given(wet) + (1 - p_wet) * rate_given(dry), and with no p_wet it uses the circuit's own shrunk wet
share (climatology). Red flags are far likelier in the wet (2020-2026: 10 of 35 wet races, 12 of 112 dry). The live
book still prices with `rate()`: `market_set(..., p_wet=...)` prices race_red_flag with `rate_wx` only when a
probability of rain is passed (racinglines/weather will supply it); rain itself is the forecast, not conditioned,
and the safety car stays on `rate()` because conditioning it was worse in the walk-forward (WX_KINDS). `check()` scores both: `climatology` (p_wet = the circuit's past wet share) and
`wet_oracle` (p_wet = the race's realised wet flag, the ceiling a perfect forecast would reach).

Weather-aware (-WX) variants. Which kinds a probability of rain moves is schema, not code: each kind's `wx`
(markets/kinds.py; `wx = "..."` in markets/kinds.toml). "rate" kinds (WX_KINDS: race_red_flag) are priced with
rate_wx; "dnf" kinds (WX_DNF_KINDS: the classification and retirement kinds) from the run's dnf_prob times
wx_scale(hist, venue_id, p_wet), the circuit's retirement rate (dnf_rate = n_dnf / n per race) at that p_wet over the
same at its climatological wet share. `check(..., forecast=)` adds `circuit-WX` (rate_wx with a real forecast issued
days before, weather/leads.p_wet) and its paired Brier difference against `circuit`; dnf_check.py's `model-WX` is the
retirement twin.

Fastest lap: from history, how often the fastest lap goes to a driver finishing 1st, 2nd-3rd, 4th-10th, lower,
or not finishing (per driver in that bucket); a driver's price is his bucket probabilities from the stage run
(win, podium, top 10, DNF) times those rates, scaled so the field sums to 1.
