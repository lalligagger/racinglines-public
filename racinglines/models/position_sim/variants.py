Named model variants: combinations of the challenger switches in model.py
(docs/f1-roadmap.md, F1-2 / F1-3). "baseline" is today's default model.

    with variants.use("grid+pretrain"):
        hist = pricing.history(meas)          # build history INSIDE the variant: features differ

Names combine with "+". Each run that prices with a variant records its name
(params.variant), so stored sweep stages and backtests are never mixed.
