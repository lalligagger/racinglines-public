"""
Account roles and access tiers, in one place.

    admin   everything, plus the activity log, user management and the database explorer
    pro     every maker and taker strategy, the private book, and the Lab (backtests, Edge Finder,
            diagnostics, replays)
    basic   "Your picks": a blend of BASIC_PICKS taker strategies drawn per account from profiles.TAKER_TOP
            (basic_members), on Markets / Strategy / Positions / Live; never which strategy made a pick, no fair
            values or edges (a 1-3 star rating instead, pick_stars), no book, no Lab

`pro` and `basic` were called `maker` and `taker` until 2026-09-30. Rows written before then still carry the old
spelling (no migration in that change): `canonical()` maps them, every user dict the app builds goes through it,
and `db_roles()` spells both forms for SQL `role IN (...)` filters. A one-line migration
(`UPDATE users SET role = 'pro' WHERE role = 'maker'`, same for taker -> basic) retires the aliases; until it runs,
nothing here breaks on either spelling. Strategy names (`maker` / `update` / `hold` ... in candidates and sweeps)
are not roles and are untouched.
