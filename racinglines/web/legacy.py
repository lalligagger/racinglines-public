"""
Old page URLs, redirected to their current routes (bookmarks, links in old messages and alerts).
Routes were renamed to match page names (docs/webapp.md, Pages):

    /            -> /markets              /bet -> /markets           /me -> /positions
    /signals     -> /strategy             /pm  -> /markets/polymarket
    /house       -> /book/quotes          /house/sheet -> /book/quotes/sheet    /house/{id} -> /book/markets/{id}
    /race/{id}   -> /races/{id}           /season/{code} -> /seasons/{code}
    /diag[/{id}] -> /lab/diagnostics[/{id}]                /runs[/{id}] -> /lab/runs[/{id}]
    /markets/{id}, /markets/lookup -> /markets/linked/{id}, /markets/linked/lookup   (admin: linked markets)

GET only: forms post to the current routes. Registered after every real route, so they never shadow one.
