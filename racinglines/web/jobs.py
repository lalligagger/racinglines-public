"""
Model runs launched from the web app.

Each job type is a CLI command with a few typed knobs; the Lab page renders the
form from this catalog, so every sport gets the same UI. Jobs run one at a time
in a background thread as a subprocess (the same code path as the command line),
stream progress into the `jobs` table and link to the model run they saved.

Guard rails:
  - forecasts launched here are saved as kind='scenario': live prices only change
    when a maker promotes one (see promote());
  - backtests and diagnostics use the same as-of pricing as the CLI (no leakage
    by construction), whatever the knobs.
